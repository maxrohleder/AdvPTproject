- optimal worker distro idea: 
    - optimal worker distro at timepoint is dependant on next planned build
    - when building succeded, we set redistribute to true, so next time we try to build something in checkResources we toggle worker redistribution
    - everytime we try to build something, we redistribute workers according to the needed resources
    - after we pop an item from buildlist --> set revision_needed to true
    - everytime we build a worker/assimilator --> increment revision; next time we try to build something --> redistribute workers
    - works perfectly in case of assimilator or probe finish. when a item is build it takes one timestep to redistribute
check:
    - protoss_status 57
        - add to printlist always or only if we will not build something
